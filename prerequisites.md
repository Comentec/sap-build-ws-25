# Prerequisites
These prerequisites are essential to a successful workshop.
## Working environment
While there are many ways to work with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, with a wide choice of editors and command lines, we will use the SAP Business Application Studio. It provides a user-friendly interface and integrates well with SAP services.
